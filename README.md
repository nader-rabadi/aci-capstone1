 # Capstone Project: Building a Customer Onboarding Serverless Application on AWS

This capstone project, part of the AWS Cloud Institute's Cloud Application Developer Track, provided a hands-on, challenge-based lab experience where I leveraged AWS services and the Boto3 Python library to design and build a serverless application on AWS. The project involved integrating a range of AWS services, such as S3, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, Lambda, Rekognition, Textract, SAM, API Gateway, Step Functions, and IAM Permission Policies and Roles.

This project contains two main components, each is organized into separate folders. Below is a brief description of each folder and its contents.

-**SynchronousOperation**: This is Part 1 of the project. The objective is to develop the serverless application where all operations are executed synchronously.
 - For more details, please check the readme_part1.md file inside **SynchronousOperation** folder.

-**AsynchronousOperation**: This is Part 2 of the project. Its objective is to modify the serverless application in Part 1 in such a way that some operations are executed asynchronously. A state machine workflow is developed utilizing AWS Step Functions.
 - For more details, please check the readme_part2.md file inside **AsynchronousOperation** folder.
